A functional and secure mobile wallet is essential in the democratization of any peer-to-peer monetary system. The initial Android version of our mobile wallet included the basics and some advanced features from the Desktop wallet. Now iOS users will also be able to take full advantage of the Skycoin Ecosystem from the convenience of their phone or tablet.

We've also included a more advanced feature where you can select the specific UTXO (unspent outputs) for sending Skycoin. This allows a more flexible customization of Coin Hours usage for your needs.

Pro Security tip: For best cryptography hygiene practices, only use each address once and never recycle them!

The Skycoin team is not stopping here - continuous developments are coming along at a rapid pace. Stay tuned for more exciting releases in the near future!
